# foobar--challenge-2.1

My solution to the third question in the Google Foobar Challenge.

I convert each entry into three individual numbers with leading 0's out to a thousand-place. '1' would be converted to '001'.

The presence of an additional '.0' in the versioning is used to decrement appropriate versions so that '1' is higher than '1.0'

The results are placed into an object, one for each version, that is then sorted according to the number generated by the algorithm, but outputs the original version number.
